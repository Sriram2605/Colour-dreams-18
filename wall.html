            <h1>WALL Painting</h1>
            Wall painting, also known as mural painting, involves applying paint directly onto walls, ceilings, or other large permanent surfaces. This art form has been practiced since ancient times, with examples found in prehistoric caves, Egyptian tombs, and classical Roman buildings. Wall paintings can serve decorative, narrative, or symbolic purposes, reflecting cultural, religious, or historical themes.

There are several techniques used in wall <br>

1. Fresco: A technique where pigments mixed with water are applied onto wet plaster, resulting in a durable image as the paint becomes part of the wall surface when it dries. The Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo is a famous example. <br>
2. Secco: In this method, pigments are applied to dry plaster. Though it allows for more time to work, it is less durable than fresco. <br>
3. Tempera: This method uses pigments mixed with a binding agent such as egg yolk and applied to the wall surface, often seen in ancient and medieval art. <br>
4. Acrylics and modern paints: These are more commonly used in contemporary murals. Acrylic paints are durable, quick-drying, and versatile, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor works. <br>
Wall paintings are often large-scale and can cover entire surfaces, making them a key feature of architecture and interior design.they are also used in public spaces to convey social messages,beautify environments,or preserve cultural heritage. <br>
